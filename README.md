# ChunkMap

In the map, a chunk is displayed as a quad with a color which provides some information.

### Basic Operations

- L : Switch to chunk loading viewer mode.

- G : Switch to chunk generation viewer mode.

- T : Switch to ticket vierer mode.

- E : Toggle the entity overlay.

- W,A,S and D : Move the center of the map.If one of these keys are pressed while the Alt key is down,the center of the map will be moved to 16 instead of 1 chunks away.

- M : Open a dialog where you can move the center of the map to a given chunkpos.
- H : Help.
- 0 : Move to the Nether

- 1 : Move to the Overworld.

- 2 : Move to the End.
- Double click a chunk : Get more information about the chunk,or load the chunk to a given level (31,or entity processing bydefault).


### Known Problems

- The MSPT it uses up may be too high(about 12).

- If you want to interact with the window of the map,it is necessary to open the game to the LAN (Maybe it can never be fixed).

- The manually loaded chunks may fail to be unloaded beacuse of a problem related to the synchornization of the ticket list.
